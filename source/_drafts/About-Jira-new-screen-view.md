1. **Quick-add buttons**: Add attachments and subtasks; link to issues, any URL, and content from Atlassian Marketplace apps.
2. **Transition issues**: Quickly get from to-do to done, and any status or workflow step in between.
3. **Watch, vote, and more actions**: Watch the issue, vote, give feedback, and perform other issue actions like move and clone.
4. **Pinned fields**: Pin your most important and frequently used fields to the top of the issue view, including the ones under the “Show more” link.
5. **More fields**: Assignee, labels, components, time tracking, custom fields, and more. Choose Show more to view all issue fields.
6. **Configure issue layout**: Move, hide, and change fields in the new issue view. Learn more about configuring the new issue view's field layout
7. **Activity section**: Always there, so you can quickly add a comment no matter how far you've scrolled. Change comment permissions, and link quickly.
8. **Attachments**: Switch between the strip and list view for attachments, or download them all at once to work with them on your device.
9. **Flexible layout**: Fields can be put in the place that works best for you. Admins can configure fields to be on both the left and right hand sides of the issue view.
